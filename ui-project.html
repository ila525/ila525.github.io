                <strong>Research</strong>

                <p>
                    To begin the project, research was conducted on existing frameworks 
                    for user registration processes, as well as investigating our current flow 
                    to determine irrelevant pages, broken links, and confusing areas.</p>

                <strong>User flow</strong>

                <p>Clients can create a new project through the “Create a new project” button on the 
                    Dashboard. This button was originally called “Register new app”, and should be 
                    renamed “create a new project”. This button should redirect the client to the 
                    project details page with a Bootstrap modal displaying the “create project name” 
                    window on top of the Dashboard page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through the “Create New Project” page, the client names their project. There is one 
                    text entry field on this screen, for the project name. There is a create button at 
                    the bottom of the page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project name exists to help clients organize/label their projects. This title 
                    appears on the DC to help keep the UI organized by project. Next to the project 
                    name field, there is an information icon that explains that the project name is 
                    displayed on the dashboard. Underneath the input field, there is text detailing 
                    the technical requirements for the project name field. The project name is limited 
                    to entries that use text and numbers only, and each project name must be unique. The 
                    project name field also should be limited to varchar 255. To implement this, the 
                    field should stop allowing inputs after the maximum size allowance has been exceeded. 
                    The project name field cannot be left blank.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The client may click the “create” button to finish creating their project and go 
                    to their project details.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following error messages exist: “The project name must be unique” (user enters 
                    an existing project name), “Project must be named” (user clicked create 
                    without naming the project), and “Only alphanumeric numbers may be used 
                    for project name” (user entered invalid characters) These messages should be
                    implemented as bootstrap alerts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The aim of this project is to redesign the app flow. 
                    In the old designs, clients had to input their package name as a required 
                    ield in order to create a new app and get the required credentials. This 
                    project eliminates the need for entering the package name. Clients only 
                    need a unique project name to register a new project. Once the project is 
                    created, clients will be redirected to the credentials page where they can 
                    access their credentials based on the platform. The scope of the project is to 
                    create an app flow only for creating a new app. Editing or changing the credentials
                    page is out of scope for this project.
